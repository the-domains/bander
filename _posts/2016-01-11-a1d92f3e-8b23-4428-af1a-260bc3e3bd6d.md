So this is my first Grid post, and I'm really just taking a look at how this is supposed to work. I thought it was supposed to automatically add content based on social media outlets (or something of that nature - I'm not 100% sure), but it kind of looks like a glorified blogging platform.

Which is still very cool, don't get me wrong. I have a sincere desire to blog; my only issue is that 1\. I don't typically have the time to keep my blog updated, 2\. technology being what it is, new blog platforms are created all the time, and I'm a new-and-shiny junkie, and 3\. I can't seem to keep it all in one place.

We'll see how this works. This could easily become my blog, which would be cool. It could also become my business site, which would be even cooler, but I'll have to see what the e-commerce capabilities are.
